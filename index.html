        <p>Applications on the Internet occasionally have negative impacts on our lives. Online fraud is one of the traumatizing experiences I have had before.

Though I realized it on time and called police for my friend, some people she friended on Ins still got conned and lost certain amount of money. This was not only a crime, but was also destruction to interaction and trust between people when they communicate with each other online.</p>
